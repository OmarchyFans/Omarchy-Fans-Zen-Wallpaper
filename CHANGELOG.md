# Changelog

The bar popup reads the newest sections of this file to tell you what changed
when an update is available. Keep one short line per bullet.

## 0.4.2

- Every yt-dlp and ffmpeg call now has a total deadline (default 25s/20s, killed with SIGKILL after a 5s grace) and yt-dlp's captured output is capped at 4MB, matching the existing curl bounds. A stalled or oversized remote response can no longer hold the wallpaper service indefinitely or grow a shell variable without bound.

## 0.4.1

- Shortened the manifest description to fit the marketplace's 500-character limit

## 0.4.0

- Renamed to Zen Wallpaper (repository Omarchy-Fans-Zen-Wallpaper, plugin id fans.omarchy.zen-wallpaper, command omarchy-zen)
- Upgrading from Daily Zen Wallpaper: run its uninstall.sh, remove the old plugin, add this one; bookmarks, ratings and settings move over on first run
- Marketplace release: README and listing explain how the wallpaper becomes a stream, the library of streams, and the MIT license

## 0.3.0

- Library rows show YouTube views (or viewers for live streams) and how often every install played the stream
- The Library selector counts your bookmarks per category and per creator
- The row you pick lights up as playing right away; the chip refreshes every 10 s
- Chip icon: pause while the stream plays, play while it is paused (the media convention)
- Plays are counted once per install and day and shared like the stars; share-ratings off keeps them local

## 0.2.0

- Library: the ten most popular long streams per category (lofi, work, study, focus, zen, ambient, jazz, sleep, classical, synthwave, 24/7 streams), refreshed from the main branch daily
- Creators: follow YouTube channels (Aether Journey is in from the start); play a creator to get their newest stream every day
- Bookmarks and 1–5 star ratings on every entry; ratings are shared with every install through the omarchy.fans ratings API
- The stream resumes where it left off after a shell restart or a reboot
- "Make your own music with Suno" link at the top of the popup

## 0.1.1

- The animated wallpaper plays on every monitor (set `screen` in the config to keep it to one)
- No black screen while the stream buffers: the window appears with the first decoded frame
- The music keeps playing behind fullscreen windows; only the video pauses
- The quality dropdown follows changes made from the command line

## 0.1.0

- Animated wallpaper from a YouTube mood stream, with sound, on the layer under your windows
- Still mode: a fresh frame from the stream becomes your Omarchy background every day
- "Make a theme": Aether extracts a palette from the current scene and applies it as an Omarchy theme
- Bar chip with mode, sound, volume, quality and daily options; `omarchy-zen` command line
- Update alerts in the popup when a newer version is published
